// js/wordbound/combat.js
// Ties lexicon.js (scoring) + traits.js (weakness/resistance) + a monster
// instance together into one resolved attack. This is the Wordbound
// equivalent of the old game's Combat.resolveAttack, but the "attack" is
// always a played word, never a stat.
//
// PUBLIC API (window.Wordbound.Combat):
//   playWord(player, monster, word, comboState)
//     -> null if the word isn't formable/valid (caller should reject before
//        spending a turn; "valid" also accepts an exactly-3-letter non-word
//        combination when the player owns Poetic License, see items.js's
//        Items.bypassesWordValidity -- ITEMS ticket, GOALS.md), otherwise:
//        { word, tilesUsed, score, holdMult, activeTraitId, multiplier,
//          comboMultiplier, comboAtPlay, isRepeat, damage, monsterDied }
//        tilesUsed is the array of tiles.js Tile objects spent. holdMult is
//        the combined MULT_ON_HOLD multiplier from tiles left in the rack.
//        multiplier is just the trait (weakness/resistance) multiplier.
//        damage = round(score.total * holdMult * multiplier * comboMultiplier),
//        then halved-ish (x0.4, rounded) if isRepeat.
//     comboState (optional, GOALS.md "FUN OVERHAUL 1/8"): { combo, usedWords }
//     tracked per-fight by the caller (reset at combat start). combo is the
//     number of consecutive DISTINCT words played so far this fight (capped
//     at 5 for the multiplier, +12%/stack); usedWords is a Set of words
//     (uppercased) already played this fight. Passing this in is optional --
//     omit it (or pass nothing) to get plain trait-multiplier damage with no
//     combo/repeat adjustment, e.g. for callers that don't track a fight
//     (tests, tools). When provided, playWord mutates it: a repeat resets
//     combo to 0, a distinct word increments it by 1 and adds the word to
//     usedWords -- both for the NEXT call, not this one (this call's bonus
//     uses the combo value as it was BEFORE this word).
//     On success, mutates player.rack (removes used tiles) and monster.hp.
//     Does NOT refill/discard the rack or advance the turn -- caller's job.
//
//   monsterAttack(player, monster)
//     -> { damage } and mutates player.ink (clamped at 0). Flat damage for
//        now (no player defense stat in this redesign -- deliberately
//        simpler than the old game).
//
// INK SPEND (GOALS.md "FEATURE, STRUCTURAL... replace player HP with INK",
// run 2/2-4): Overcharge is the "big plays can spend it" mana half of the
// ink resource. Pass { overcharge: true } as playWord/previewWord's 5th
// arg to spend Combat.OVERCHARGE_INK_COST ink (the CALLER's job -- this
// file only knows how to multiply damage, not deduct a resource) for
// Combat.OVERCHARGE_DAMAGE_MULTIPLIER extra damage on the word about to be
// played. Baseline word play is entirely unaffected when the flag is
// omitted/false, matching the ticket's "baseline word play stays FREE"
// requirement.
//
// DUEL-GAUGE COMBAT (GOALS.md, integration bridge run, js/wordbound/
// duelCombat.js): pass { skipDamage: true } as playWord's 5th arg to get the
// exact same scoring/rack-mutation/combo-tracking as always, WITHOUT the
// direct `monster.hp -= damage` line below -- gauge combat resolves damage
// only when a duel PUSH is won (js/wordbound/duel.js), not per word, so the
// caller (duelCombat.js) needs the score number without this file also
// mutating hp on its own. `result.damage` is unaffected either way -- it's
// still the full scrabble-system number (tiles, length, weaknesses, combo,
// overcharge), the exact "word score" the duel-gauge ticket's push-force
// conversion is built on. Omitted/false (every turn-based call site,
// unchanged) behaves exactly as before.
