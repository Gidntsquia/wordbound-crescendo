# Progress log — Wordbound: Crescendo

Append-only. One entry per run: what was done, current state, what's next, what was
actually verified vs. not. Never edit past entries. Real timestamps only
(`date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%MZ`); trust `git log` over self-reported times.

## 2026-08-21T07:30Z — repo created (orchestrator)

Seeded as a full working-tree copy of sibling repo descent-of-essence at its v0.42
state (Wordbound engine: ink system, branching-map work in flight there, woodcut CSS,
audio module with the AudioContext-resume fix, full test harness). GOALS.md holds the
complete ticket arc for the words-vs-music concept; ROADMAP.md the milestones;
standing decisions (synthesized PD music only, woodcut default, naming) are in
GOALS.md's header. Nothing pruned yet — the first ticket is the prune. Next run:
start the SCAFFOLD/PRUNE ticket.

## 2026-08-21T07:35Z — SCAFFOLD/PRUNE complete (orchestrator)

**What was done:** completed GOALS.md's first ticket. Before touching anything,
grepped the whole repo (test/, tools/, js/wordbound/) for references to the Descent
of Essence game's files — confirmed zero test or tool file depends on index.html,
css/style.css, js/core/constants.js, js/core/utils.js, js/data/*, js/systems/*,
js/ui/*, js/game.js, or js/main.js. test/dom-check.js already defaults to
wordbound.html only (its optional CLI arg for index.html is for the itch-build
staging check, which itself renames a copy of wordbound.html to index.html — not the
real Descent index.html). So:
1. Deleted the 21 Descent-only files listed above via `git rm` (index.html,
   css/style.css, js/core/{constants,utils}.js, all of js/data/, js/systems/,
   js/ui/, js/game.js, js/main.js).
2. Trimmed js/core/namespace.js: it stubbed out window.Game.{Constants, Utils,
   Data, Systems, UI, State} for the now-deleted Descent modules; nothing under
   window.Wordbound or in test/tools ever read those keys (grepped to confirm), so
   cut it down to just `window.Game = { RNG: {} }`, which is the one thing
   js/core/rng.js and the Wordbound engine actually use.
3. Renamed wordbound.html's displayed branding: `<title>`, the main-menu `<h1>`
   ("WORDBOUND" → "WORDBOUND: CRESCENDO"), and version-info ("v0.42" → "v0.1"). Left
   the tagline/menu-goal flavor text (Loose Words, the Stacks) alone — that's
   THEME.md-driven lore and the theme-bible ticket owns replacing it, per GOALS.md's
   explicit note.
4. Rewrote README.md: one paragraph on the words-vs-music concept + crescendo/parry
   mechanic, states it's engine-forked from descent-of-essence (with no compat
   obligation), quickstart (open wordbound.html / local server), test commands, a
   trimmed project-layout tree (dropped the Descent-era file list), and a shorter
   license section. Removed the sibling's own itch.io play link, feature list, and
   full how-to-play (not accurate to Crescendo's still-unbuilt mechanics; the theme
   and later tickets will re-add game-accurate copy).
5. Updated package.json: renamed the npm package "wordbound" → "wordbound-crescendo"
   and rewrote its description off the Descent/Wordbound wording. package-lock.json
   picked up the matching name automatically via the ensure-deps installs run during
   verification (not hand-edited).
6. tools/build-itch.js needed NO changes — it already staged Wordbound's exact
   dependency list independent of the real index.html (comment in the file already
   explained this: it copies wordbound.html to a staging index.html itself, it
   never touches the repo's own index.html). Sanity-checked it still works as-is.

**Verified (all green, this run, on the pruned tree):**
- `npm test` (test/dom-check.js, jsdom): ALL CHECKS PASSED, full suite, zero
  console errors.
- `npm run test:qa` (test/orchestrator-qa-boss-reward.js, real Playwright/Chromium):
  ALL CHECKS PASSED — real clicks through character select, a full boss fight with
  its reward flow, at both 375px and full-size viewports, zero page errors. This is
  the "game boots and plays a fight in a real browser" bar from the ticket.
- `npm run test:mobile` (real Playwright): ALL CHECKS PASSED at 375px/414px across
  main menu, combat, tile-reward, and game-over screens, plus touch-mode input.
- `npm run build:itch` + `npm run test:itch-build`: zip built (1.44 MB), the
  unzipped index.html passes the full 16/16 dom-check suite and loads with zero
  404s/errors in a real browser.

**Not verified / not applicable:** no audio-specific check was re-run here (nothing
audio-related changed this ticket; `npm run test:audio` exists and was not touched).
No human playtest of the renamed title — it's a two-string text change, low risk,
but "does it read right" is Jaxon's call same as any copy.

**Current state:** repo is now Crescendo's own — no Descent of Essence code remains,
`npm test`/`test:qa`/`test:mobile`/build:itch all clean on the pruned tree,
wordbound.html displays as "Wordbound: Crescendo" v0.1. THEME.md is untouched
(still the sibling's library lore, as GOALS.md instructed — next ticket replaces
it).

**Next:** THEME BIBLE ticket — replace THEME.md with the Crescendo world bible
(faction name, player role, 3 vetted famous-piece bosses, 6-10 vetted lesser-known
regulars, PD vetting notes, a display-name proposal for Jaxon).

## 2026-08-21T08:49Z — THEME BIBLE complete (orchestrator)

**What was done:** completed GOALS.md's THEME BIBLE ticket, rewriting THEME.md as
the Crescendo world bible (design doc only — no code touched).

- **Premise:** player is a Junior Lyricist at the Concert Eternal (a concert hall
  vast enough to stage every piece ever written, mirroring the sibling's Boundless
  Archive naming pattern); the antagonist faction is the Fermata, who staged a coup
  and stole the alphabet so music alone would fill the world. Tone note up top:
  operatic melodrama played mostly straight, explicitly contrasted with the
  sibling's whimsical library-pun tone so future sessions don't default to the
  wrong voice.
- **Duel-gauge naming** (per the header's amended combat model): the gauge itself
  is named **the Volume** (loudness dial / book pun); health blocks are named
  **Verses** (song unit and poetry unit at once). Both are flagged as proposals
  for Jaxon per the standing rule, with the alternates I considered and rejected
  noted so the reasoning isn't lost.
- **3 floor bosses + 1 final boss**, each with a name, personality tied directly to
  their piece's actual dynamics (not generic flavor), and a proposed hostage
  letter: The Mountain King (Grieg, accelerando as the mechanic-teaching first
  boss), Death the Fiddler (Saint-Saëns' Danse Macabre, lull-then-sting structure),
  the Valkyrie Marshal (Wagner, continuous late-tier pressure), and the Maestro
  (Beethoven's 5th — ties the boss's "Fate knocking" personality straight to the
  symphony's own historical nickname for its opening motif; four movements =
  four proposed fight phases, per the header's final-boss note).
- **9 regulars, 3 per tier** (early/mid/late), each a lesser-known piece with a
  one-line gimmick tied to its real musical structure (e.g. the Metronome/Czerny
  for the "metronome-creature" GOALS.md suggested, the Organist/Bach Toccata &
  Fugue for late-tier's biggest single spikes).
- **PD vetting table** covering all 9 GOALS.md-suggested famous-piece candidates
  (not just the 3 used) — composer death year and years-since for each, so the
  3 unused ones (Queen of the Night, Moonlight 3rd mvt, Vivaldi Summer/Winter) are
  pre-vetted and ready for milestone-2 roster expansion instead of needing
  re-vetting later. Noted the Toccata & Fugue's disputed-authorship trivia
  explicitly since it doesn't change the PD verdict either way.
- **Display name:** proposed keeping "Wordbound: Crescendo" (mechanic is in the
  title, keeps the sibling-branding pattern), listed 3 alternatives considered and
  set aside with reasons, flagged for Jaxon per the standing rule — did NOT touch
  wordbound.html's branding, that's Jaxon's call same as the SCAFFOLD ticket left
  it.
- **Stolen letters:** added a proposal section (not this ticket's job, but useful
  for the next meta-progression ticket) noting the four hostage letters (K, V, X,
  Z) all fall inside GOALS.md's own suggested starting-stolen set (J K Q V X Z),
  which reads well thematically — flagged explicitly as the meta-progression
  ticket's decision to accept or override.
- **Concert Eternal floor map:** proposed names for the existing 3-floor structure
  (Open Rehearsal / Recital Hall / Grand Stage / the Podium for the final boss),
  explicitly noted as a proposal for whichever ticket wires floors to bosses, not
  a requirement of this one — `js/wordbound/floor.js`'s `TOTAL_FLOORS = 3` was not
  touched.

**Verified:** `npm test` (jsdom dom-check) still ALL CHECKS PASSED after the edit
— expected, since this ticket only touched THEME.md, no game code or DOM. Per the
ticket's own VERIFY line ("n/a, design doc — but keep it consistent with what the
engine can do"): cross-checked every naming/mechanic reference in the new THEME.md
against what GOALS.md's header decisions and the existing engine (floor.js's
3-floor structure) actually support — no invented mechanics beyond what's already
decided or already-ticketed.

**Not verified / not applicable:** nothing here is code, so `test:mobile`/`test:qa`
don't apply and weren't run. All naming proposals (display name, Volume, Verses,
hostage letters) are explicitly flagged for Jaxon per GOALS.md's guardrail on
naming/feel calls — none of them are final.

**Current state:** THEME.md fully replaced, GOALS.md's THEME BIBLE box checked.
Full roster (3 floor bosses + 1 final boss + 9 regulars, all PD-vetted) plus core
naming (Volume, Verses, Concert Eternal, the Fermata, Junior Lyricist) exists for
future tickets to consume. `npm test` clean.

**Next:** STRUCTURAL ticket — migrate to React + Vite, per the header FRAMEWORK
decision. This is explicitly sequenced before the music engine and duel-UI work so
those get built React-native. Multi-run ticket; expect this to span several
sessions. Read the ticket's 5 sub-steps in GOALS.md closely before starting,
especially the requirement to update GOALS.md's MANDATORY VERIFICATION header in
the same commit that changes what `npm test` means (Vitest/RTL replacing the
jsdom dom-check harness) — future runs depend on that header staying accurate.

## 2026-08-21T09:49Z — STRUCTURAL 1/5: Vite + React scaffold (orchestrator)

**What was done:** started the multi-run STRUCTURAL ticket (React + Vite migration,
GOALS.md header FRAMEWORK decision). This run is scoped to sub-step 1 only
("scaffold Vite + React in this repo") — no screen porting yet, box stays
unchecked.

- Housekeeping first: local `main` was 3 commits behind `origin/main` (session
  started with HEAD detached at the stale tip). Fast-forwarded to origin/main
  before doing anything — no data was lost, just a stale local ref.
- Added `vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react` (devDependencies) and `react`, `react-dom`
  (real dependencies, since they ship in the built bundle).
- `vite.config.mjs` (`.mjs` extension, not `.js`, so Vite's native ESM config
  loader is happy without setting `"type": "module"` in package.json — that
  would have broken every existing CommonJS `require()`-based test/tool script,
  so deliberately avoided). `base: './'` for portable static hosting (itch zip
  or a GitHub Pages subpath, deploy itself still deferred per the ticket).
  `build.outDir: 'dist/app'` — NOT bare `dist/`, because `tools/build-itch.js`
  already writes `dist/wordbound-itch.zip` and Vite's default `emptyOutDir`
  would silently wipe it on the next `vite build`. Verified both builds now
  coexist in `dist/` without collision.
- Root `index.html` (Vite's entry-point convention) + `src/main.jsx` +
  `src/App.jsx`. `App.jsx` is an explicit, honestly-labeled placeholder (not a
  fake screen) stating the React port is in progress and that `wordbound.html`
  is still the playable game meanwhile — screens get ported in one at a time
  in follow-up runs per the ticket's own "port screen by screen, keep commits
  working" instruction.
- `npm run dev` / `build` / `preview` scripts added. `wordbound.html`, `css/`,
  `js/wordbound/*`, `js/core/*`, and `test/*` are completely untouched this run.

**Verified:**
- `npm run build`: clean, no warnings, `dist/app/index.html` + hashed JS bundle
  produced.
- Real-browser check (Playwright, chromium via `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`):
  served the built output with `npm run preview`, loaded it in a real page,
  confirmed the React root actually rendered ("Wordbound: Crescendo" text
  present) with ZERO console/page errors. Deleted the throwaway script after.
- `npm test` (jsdom dom-check, 100+ assertions): ALL CHECKS PASSED, unaffected
  by the scaffold — expected, since no game file changed.
- `npm run test:qa` (Playwright, boss-reward flow + 375px viewport): ALL CHECKS
  PASSED, zero console/page errors.
- `npm run test:mobile` (Playwright, 375/414px + touch-mode input): all layouts
  OK, touch-mode OK.
- `npm run build:itch` + `npm run test:itch-build`: itch zip still builds
  (1.44 MB), still passes the full 16/16 dom-check suite unzipped + loads with
  zero 404s in a real browser — confirmed this AFTER adding the outDir fix, so
  the collision I found never actually shipped.

**Not verified / not applicable:** no React component has real game behavior
yet, so there's nothing gameplay-shaped to Playwright-test on the React side
beyond "did it render and stay error-free," which is what was checked. GOALS.md's
MANDATORY VERIFICATION header is intentionally NOT updated yet — the ticket says
to update it "in the same commit that changes what `npm test` means," and
`npm test` still means the same jsdom dom-check it always has; that header edit
lands with the Vitest/RTL migration (ticket sub-step 3), not this one.

**Current state:** repo now has two coexisting toolchains: the untouched
vanilla `wordbound.html` (still the actual playable game, still what `npm test`
covers) and a fresh Vite+React scaffold (`index.html` at root, `src/`) that
boots but has no real screens yet. `dist/` stays gitignored as before. All
pre-existing gates green.

**Next:** continue the STRUCTURAL ticket's sub-step 1/2 — port the first real
screen (main menu is the simplest: static content, one seeded-run and one
how-to-play button, no combat state) into a React component that reads from
`window.Wordbound` data modules, proving the "game logic stays framework-
agnostic plain JS, import it from React" pattern before tackling anything
stateful like the combat screen. That'll likely require converting at least
the specific modules the main menu touches (achievements display, character
data if the button leads there) toward an ES-module-friendly shape without
breaking the global-namespace pattern `wordbound.html`'s script tags still
depend on — worth thinking through carefully rather than rushing, since a
half-converted module could break the still-live vanilla game. After the
main-menu proof of concept, continue screen by screen per the ticket order;
Vitest/RTL test migration (sub-step 3) can start once there's real component
behavior worth testing.
