// test/balance-simulation.js -- systematic difficulty/balance simulation.
//
// Plays many full runs headlessly by driving the REAL game API (Game.startRun,
// Game.enterCurrentNode, Game.submitWord, ...) inside a single jsdom document,
// then reports per-floor win rates and per-monster kill rates so numeric
// outliers stand out (one monster killing far more runs than its floor peers).
//
// It deliberately does NOT reimplement the combat loop -- an independent
// reimplementation would measure the simulation's balance, not the game's.
// The page is loaded once and Game.startRun() is called per run, because
// parsing the 2.5MB wordlist takes ~3s and doing that per run would dominate
// the runtime.
//
// Two bot strategies bracket skilled vs. unskilled play:
//   best  -- exhaustive search, plays the highest-damage word available
//   first -- plays the first playable word it finds (any damage > 0)
//
// Usage: node test/balance-simulation.js [runsPerStrategy]   (default 15)
//
// LIMITATIONS (don't over-read the numbers):
//   - The bot can use AT MOST one blank ('?') tile per word (2026-08-20 --
//     it used to use none at all, which badly undercounted playable words
//     once the balance pass made fights take multiple turns; see
//     findPlayableWords). A rack needing 2+ blanks in the same word (e.g.
//     from the Second Draft item, which adds blanks) still won't be found.
//   - The bot never uses the rack-reorder UI, and always takes shop/
//     treasure/event option ordering greedily. So these win rates are a
//     floor, not a ceiling, on human performance. (Consumables no longer
//     exist -- PLAYTEST FINDINGS 3 item 1, GOALS.md, 2026-08-22.)
//   - jsdom has no Web Audio API; audio paths are inert here (already true of
//     npm test). Nothing in this script depends on them.
//   - (Fixed 2026-08-20, see the combat-loop's effectiveRack filter) the bot
//     used to be unaware of a monster's Hex lock and could loop proposing
//     the same rejected word to MAX_WORDS_PER_COMBAT, reporting a false
//     stall with 0 damage taken on both sides. Noted here since it was the
//     root cause behind a run of misleadingly bad gate numbers.
